Time-Harmonic Maxwell's Equations (05-hcurl)
--------------------------------------------

Model problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example solves the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in an L-shaped domain and it 
describes the diffraction of an electromagnetic wave from a re-entrant corner. It comes with an 
exact solution that contains a strong singularity.

Equation solved: Time-harmonic Maxwell's equations

.. math::
    :label: example-05-hcurl-adapt

    \frac{1}{\mu_r} \nabla \times \nabla \times E - \kappa^2 \epsilon_r E = \Phi.

Domain of interest is the square $(-10, 10)^2$ missing the quarter lying in the 
fourth quadrant. It is filled with air:

Boundary conditions: Combined essential and natural, see the file "main.cpp".

Exact solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
    :label: example-05-hcurl-adapt-exact

    E(x, y) = \nabla \times J_{\alpha} (r) \cos(\alpha \theta)

where $J_{\alpha}$ is the Bessel function of the first kind, 
$(r, \theta)$ the polar coordinates and $\alpha = 2/3$. 
For the source code of the Bessel function $\bfJ_{\alpha}$ 
see the file definitions.cpp.

Weak forms
~~~~~~~~~~

The weak formulation is put together as a combination of default jacobian and 
residual forms in the Hcurl space, and one custom form that defines the 
integral of the tangential component of the exact solution along the boundary.
For details see files definitions.h and definitions.cpp. 

Creating a complex Hcurl space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we use the Hcurl space::

    // Create an Hcurl space with default shapeset.
    HcurlSpace<std::complex<double> > space(&mesh, &bcs, P_INIT);

Choosing refinement selector for the Hcurl space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also need to use a refinement selector for the Hcurl space::

    // Initialize refinement selector.
    HcurlProjBasedSelector selector(CAND_LIST, CONV_EXP, H2DRS_DEFAULT_ORDER);

This is the last explicit occurence of the Hcurl space. The rest of the example 
is the same as if the adaptivity was done in the H1 space.

Choice of projection norm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The H2D_HCURL_NORM is used automatically for the projection, since 
the projection takes place in an Hcurl space. The user does not have to 
worry about this. If needed, the default norm can be overridden in 
the function OGProjection::project_global().

Showing real part of the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is done via a RealFilter::

    // View the coarse mesh solution and polynomial orders.
    RealFilter real_filter(&sln);
    v_view.show(&real_filter);

Calculating element errors for adaptivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Element errors and the total relative error in percent are calculated using 

::

    // Calculate element errors and total error estimate.
    info("Calculating error estimate and exact error.");
    Adapt<std::complex<double> >* adaptivity = new Adapt<std::complex<double> >(&space);
    double err_est_rel = adaptivity->calc_err_est(&sln, &ref_sln) * 100;

Also here, the Hcurl norm is used by default. 

Exact error calculation and the 'solutions_for_adapt' flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the exact error calculation, we say that we do not want the exact error
to guide automatic adaptivity::

    // Calculate exact error.
    bool solutions_for_adapt = false;
    double err_exact_rel = adaptivity->calc_err_exact(&sln, &sln_exact, 
                                                      solutions_for_adapt) * 100;

Note that the polynomial order indicated corresponds to the tangential components 
of approximation on element interfaces, not to polynomial degrees inside the elements
(those are one higher).
